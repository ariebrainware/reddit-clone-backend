# Reddit Clone

This repo is part of Reddit Clone that handle backend side.
I preffer to use express because it has quick boilerplate code that i need, fast, RESTful API, and well documented.
## API Design

| URL       | Method | Description       |
| --------- | ------ | ----------------- |
| /         | GET    | Root URL          |
| /post     | GET    | Show Post from DB |
| /post/add | POST   | Add new post      |

## TechStack

1. [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) with [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/) as RESTful API
2. [Redis](https://redis.io/) Database with [ioredis](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ioredis) as a module

## Issue
